# How to Draw the Mozaics of the Alhambra by Manuel Mart√≠nez Vela

This is another excellent book about Islamic geometric patterns, focusing on the Alhambra palace in Granada, Spain. It is a how to draw book filled with whole page illustrations with step by step instructions. I have the English version. The book is a treasure trove of information for anyone interested in Islamic art, geometry, or the history of the Alhambra.

The book covers almost every room in the Alhambra palace, and it is a great resource for anyone interested in learning the symmetries of the period (the palace built between 1238 and 1358). It is beautifully illustrated with high-quality images and diagrams that help to explain the complex geometric patterns.
