# Designing tessellations: The Secrets of Interlocking Patterns by Jinny Beyer

![cover](../assets/book_covers_and_pages/beyer_cover.png){width="200"}

This is a very good book for anyone interested in designing tessellations and interlocking patterns. The author, Jinny Beyer, is a well-known quilter and designer, and she provides a wealth of information on the subject. She has been teaching and designing for over 30 years, and her expertise shines through in this book.

Unlike many other books on the subject, this one is not just a collection of patterns. Instead, it focuses on the principles of design and how to create your own unique tessellations. The author provides clear explanations and step-by-step instructions for creating wallpaper-patterns.

Even though she is not a mathematician, she has a good understanding of the mathematical principles underlying tessellations and patterns. She explains these concepts in a way that is accessible to readers without a strong math background.

I enjoyed this book a lot.
