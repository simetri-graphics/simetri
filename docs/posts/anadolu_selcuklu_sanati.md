## The Geometric Language of Anatolian Seljuk Art

This is a gorgeous three volume set that explores the geometric patterns found in Anatolian Seljuk art. The book is a comprehensive study of the geometric patterns used in the art and architecture of the Seljuk period in Anatolia, which lasted from the 11th to the 13th centuries. The author, Serap Ekizler Sönmez, has meticulously documented and analyzed these patterns.

It went out of print quickly, and it is very hard to find. The book is a treasure trove of information for anyone interested in Islamic art, geometry, or the history of the Seljuk period. It is beautifully illustrated with high-quality images and diagrams that help to explain the complex geometric patterns.

The book is in Turkish, but it is a how to draw book filled with whole page illustrations with no text, and you would not be missing much if you do not read Turkish.

Translated from the [publisher's website](https://www.ketebe.com/anadolu-selcuklu-sanatinin-geometrik-dili-serap-ekizler-sonmez):
"We proudly present the Geometric Language of Anatolian Seljuk Art, a two-year effort by Serap Ekizler Sönmez, who has created a special work for architects, mathematicians, art historians, science historians, designers, traditional artists and anyone interested in geometric pattern analysis.

Geometric patterns, the most powerful indicators of the richness of the connection between science and art in Islamic Civilization, continue to live with us like doors opening to the soul of the lands we live on. Serap Ekizler Sönmez, who traveled every inch of this magnificent richness of Anatolia for two years and created both its visual and theoretical infrastructure, has presented a treasure to our cultural world. Knowing that the language of the cosmos is geometry, this giant work, which points out that art is a nation's effort to comprehend the world, also offers a proposal on how tradition can nourish the future.

In this work, which took more than 2 years to prepare and in which a total of 64 historical monuments from 23 cities were studied in detail, 118 patterns in various architectural structures were analyzed and how they emerged was explained step by step and shown in 1487 drawings.

The production of 118 patterns selected from those with a systematic geometric substructure was achieved with both ruler-compass construction, polygonal systems and different perspectives allowed by geometry. The most important aspect of the book that distinguishes it from other analysis books is that it draws attention to the kinship relationships between patterns and provides guiding approaches to create new designs. When viewed from this aspect, it can be said that it contains much more designs than the number of patterns analyzed."
