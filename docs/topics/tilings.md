# Tilings

It is possible to create tilings by using shapes and transformations. There will be a specific tilings module in the future. It is a very broad topic and it is tough to cover all the possibilities.

If you are interested in creating tilings, you can check out the [Tilings & Patterns](../posts/tilings_and_patterns.md) by Branko Gr√ºnbaum & G.C. Shepard. It is a great resource for learning about different types of tilings and how to create them.
