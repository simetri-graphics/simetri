# Mathematical Illustrations by Robert Casselman

![cover](../assets/book_covers_and_pages/casselman_cover.gif){width="200"}

This is the best introduction to PostScript I have ever seen. It is a bit old, but it is still relevant. The book is well-structured and covers a wide range of topics, including basic drawing, coordinate transformations, curves, and 3D graphics. The author provides clear explanations and examples, making it easy to follow along. The book also includes exercises and code snippets to help reinforce the concepts learned.

The author, Robert Casselman, is a mathematician and computer scientist who has a deep understanding of the subject matter. He presents the material in a way that is both engaging and informative. The book is suitable for anyone interested in learning about mathematical illustrations and PostScript programming.

Even if you don't have a specific interest in PostScript, this book is a great resource for anyone looking to improve their understanding of mathematics and computer graphics. The author provides a wealth of information and insights that are applicable to a wide range of fields.

The book is [available for free online](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~cass/graphics/manual/).
