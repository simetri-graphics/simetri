# The Symmetries of Things by John H. Conway, Heidi Burgiel, and Chaim Goodman-Strauss

<!-- more -->

This book is one of the rare books that covers the topic of symmetry in a comprehensive and accessible way. It is written by three experts in the field and includes many illustrations and examples to help readers understand the concepts. The book covers a wide range of topics, including symmetry groups, tilings, colorings of patterns, and the classification of patterns to list a few. It is a great resource for anyone interested in the mathematics of symmetry.

While most books approach symmetry primarily through group theory, this one takes a dual perspective, exploring symmetry through both topology and group theory. It serves as an excellent resource for anyone interested in the mathematics of symmetry and its applications in art and design. The book embodies the unique and unmistakable style of the late English mathematician John Horton Conway (December 26, 1937 – April 11, 2020), renowned for his playful and engaging approach to mathematics.
