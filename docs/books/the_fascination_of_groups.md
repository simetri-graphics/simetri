# The Fascination of Groups by F.J. Budden

![cover](../assets/book_covers_and_pages/the_fascination_of_groups.png){width="200"}

<!-- more -->

This book is the best introduction to group theory I have ever read. It serves as an excellent resource for anyone interested in the mathematics of symmetry and its applications in art and design. Written in a clear and engaging style, it assumes no prior knowledge of group theory. The book is filled with illustrations and examples that effectively clarify the concepts being discussed. While most books on group theory become difficult to read and understand for non-mathematicians after a few chapters, this one stands out—it is well-organized and easy to follow.

Internet archive has a copy of the book available for borrowing. You can find it [here](https://archive.org/details/fascinationofgro0000budd/).
